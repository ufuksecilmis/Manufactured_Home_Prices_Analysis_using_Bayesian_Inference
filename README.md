# Manufactured Home Prices Data Analysis using Bayesian Inference
 
Manufactured housing is a home unit constructed primarily or entirely off-site at factories prior to being moved to a piece of property where it is set. They are growing more popular in the US, so manufactured housing prices have been increasing. In this project, Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods will be used to analyze whether manufactured housing prices increased between 2018-2021. The questions below will be investigated.

1.	Is there a difference in mean number of manufactured housing prices from 2018 to 2019?
2.	Is there a difference in mean number of manufactured housing prices from 2019 to 2020?
3.	Is there a difference in mean number of manufactured housing prices from 2020 to 2021?


# Steps
1.Remove the missing values.

2.Likelihood, Prior, and Posterior functions will be developed.

3.Markov chain will be run using Metropolis algorithm to generate random variables from posterior distribution

4.Once random variables are obtained from posterior distribution, questions above will be investigated
